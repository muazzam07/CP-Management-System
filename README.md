# CP-Management-System
SE proj
The app we intend to make is a CP management system. This address the issue of the customer of marking CP in the class manually and then transferring all data to an excel file. We intend to make a programmed version which would have a seating plan according to the auditorium where the TA can mark CP by push of buttons or just entering the seat numbers. Hence all data of CP would be recorded in a data base which can be exported to an excel file for further usage making the task of the Ta easier.Also functionality of calculating class average CP and highest CP will be added.
